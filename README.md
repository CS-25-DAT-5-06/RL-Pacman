# Reinforcement Learning in Pac-Man

A systematic exploration of reinforcement learning methods applied to the Berkeley Pac-Man framework

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the progression from classical tabular reinforcement learning to modern deep RL approaches. We use the Berkeley AI Pac-Man environment as our testbed.

The core narrative examines how state space complexity drives the need for optimizing, illustrating fundamental concepts in reinforcement learning through concrete experimental results.

## Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture that separates concerns and enables modular experimentation:

- **Berkeley Pac-Man Framework**: Core game mechanics and physics
- **Gymnasium Wrapper**: Standardized RL interface following OpenAI Gym conventions
- **RL Agents**: Tabular Q-learning implementation, with planned extensions to DQN, PPO, and A2C
- **Experimental Framework**: Training scripts and evaluation tools

## Current Status

In development

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Gymnasium
- Stable Baselines3 (for future deep RL experiments)

## Getting Started

More detailed setup and usage instructions will be added as the project develops.

## Academic Context

This work is part of a 5th semester computer science project exploring the applications of reinforcement learning algorithms.
